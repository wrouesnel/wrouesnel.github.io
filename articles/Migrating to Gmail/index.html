          <section class="content"><h1 id="why">Why</h1>
<p>In a stitch of irony given my prior articles wrestling with a decent <span class="caps">IDLE</span> daemon for use with getmail, I’m faced with a new problem in figuring out the best way to migrate all my existing, locally hosted email to&nbsp;Gmail.</p>
<p>This is evidently not an uncommon problem for people, presumably for largely the same reasons I’m facing: although I like having everything locally on my own server, it only works in places where (1) I live in the same place as the server and (2) where my server won’t be double-<span class="caps">NAT</span>’d so dynamic DNS can actually reach&nbsp;it.</p>
<h1 id="how">How</h1>
<p>My personal email has been hosted on a Dovecot <span class="caps">IMAP</span> server in a Maildir up till now. Our tool of choice for this migration will be the venerable <a href="http://offlineimap.org/">OfflineIMAP</a> utility, available on Debian-ish systems with <code>apt-get install offlineimap</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-foreword">A&nbsp;Foreword</h2>
<p>I tried a lot to get this to work properly in a Maildir -&gt; Gmail configuration, and while it’s technically possible I couldn’t seem to get the folder creation to play nicely with tags - OfflineIMAP wants to create them with a leading separate (‘/‘ on Gmail) but Gmail itself doesn’t recognize that as root tag. There doesn’t seem to be anyway around this behavior with name translation or&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>I suspect you could work around this by uploading to a subdirectory, and then moving everything out of the subdirectory (sub-tag?) on Gmail, but didn’t try&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-file">Configuration&nbsp;file</h2>
<p>In your home directory (I did this on my home server since 7gb of email takes a long time to upload over <span class="caps">ADSL</span>) you need to create an <code>.offlineimaprc</code> file. For an <span class="caps">IMAP</span> -&gt; IMAP transfer, it has a structure something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code>[general]
accounts = Gmail-wrouesnel

# Gmail max attachment size - you&#39;ll get errors otherwise.
maxsize = 25000000
socktimeout = 600

[Account Gmail-wrouesnel]
# Note the ordering - Gmail is the &#39;local&#39; folder.
remoterepository = Local
localrepository = Gmail

[Repository Local]
type = IMAP
# This ensures we only do a 1-way transfer. If you want to do 2-way then you need a
# rule to exclude the Gmail [All Mail] folder.
readonly = True
remotehost = localhost
remoteuser = &lt;local user&gt;
remotepass = &lt;local password&gt;
ssl = yes
# I use SSL so this is needed - let it throw an error, then copy the hash back.
cert_fingerprint = 60571343279e7f43ee95000762f5fcd54ad24816
sep = .
subscribedonly = no

[Repository Gmail]
type = IMAP
ssl = yes
remotehost = imap.googlemail.com
remoteuser = &lt;gmail user&gt;
remotepass = &lt;gmail password&gt;
sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
sep = /
subscribedonly = no
</code></pre><h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>Test the process first with <code>offlineimap --dry-run</code> to check that things are going to turn out roughly how you expect. Then execute <code>offlineimap</code> to start the process. I really recommend doing this in a byobu or screen session, or at least with the <code>nohup</code> utility since a connection drop will cause offlineimap to&nbsp;abort.</p>
<p>Check back on the process once every day or so to check it’s still running - <span class="caps">OR</span> - write a shell script to re-invoke it until it succeeds (untested so I won’t propose any&nbsp;code).</p>
<h1 id="personal-thoughts">Personal&nbsp;thoughts</h1>
<p>This seems to be the most painless way to upload old email to Gmail. In my case, the move is prompted by a real life move where my <span class="caps">24TB</span> server won’t be coming with me. I followed up some options for moving my email system, for example to a Docker image for $5 a month for 20gb, but at the end of the day had to face the fact that there was a perfectly capable free-alternative available and it would just be throwing money away. Everything already operates through my Gmail accounts anyway, so it’s not like there’s a security concern there and when it comes to email you either use GPG or you’re doing nothing&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>It’s worth the observation here that the same process used for the migration can also be used for a local backup, which is a system I will most definitely be using in the future. OfflineIMAP can write Maildir natively, so there’s no need to use an <span class="caps">IMAP</span> server locally for that, and helpfully solves the “what if Gmail suddenly disappears problem” (more likely from a power failure then anything else, but my email is important to&nbsp;me).</p>
