          <section class="content"><h1>Intro</h1>
<p>3D printing is still very much in the hobbyist stage, and I am a tinkerer at heart. So flashing my printer&#39;s firmware is a basic operation - in fact it has to be a basic operation, since most configuration changes are baked into the&nbsp;firmware.</p>
<p>But, I run my printer at 250000 baud rate over <span class="caps">USB</span>. This is an excellent choice for printing since the error rate from the serial line on the Arduino is basically 0, and it&#39;s faster to boot. Excellent for rapid G-code&nbsp;sending.</p>
<p>But it can make reprogramming using the standard Arduino <span class="caps">IDE</span> a bit of a pain, and by and large I don&#39;t like the standard Arduino&nbsp;IDE.</p>
<p>The problem is that your Arduino in 3D printing mode is running at a non-standard baudrate. Linux can handle this just fine, as can the underlying programming tool of Arduino <code>avrdude</code>, but the <span class="caps">IDE</span> doesn&#39;t let you just type in what you need. Eclipse does. Get the latest version of AVRdude you can, since it makes things <em>a lot</em> easier - I have 6.0.1 which is built into Ubuntu “Trusty&nbsp;Tahr”.</p>
<h1>Reprogramming with&nbsp;Eclipse</h1>
<p>People have covered setting up Eclipse for Arduino elsewhere, and I will in the future cover my setup in my own words (I believe understanding comes from finding an idea explained in the right voice a lot of the time) but for now I&#39;ll just say it works pretty&nbsp;well.</p>
<h1>Reprogramming an Arduino Mega 2560 (or&nbsp;compatible)</h1>
<p>The basic command line you need for the Arduino Mega when it&#39;s running at 250000 bps is very simple. The avrdude command should be <code>avrdude -cstk500v2 -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b250000</code> in Eclipse. You can enter this by typing in the baud rate directly in the drop down box - Eclipse will accept it just&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>The AVRdude settings screen should look something like this when you&#39;re&nbsp;done:</p>
<p>-&gt; <img src="/articles/Flashing%20Marlin%20with%20Eclipse%20and%20AVRDude/eclipse-avrdude-screen.png" alt="AVRDude Configuration Screen">&nbsp;&lt;-</p>
<p>The benefit of this configuration is your printer (or arduino for another project) can be easily reflashed without having to time-out resetting it so you can run AVRdude at one of the “standard”&nbsp;baudrates.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that by creating a custom <code>boards.txt</code> configuration it might be possible to accomplish this in the Arduino <span class="caps">IDE</span> as well, but Eclipse is a much easier to use dev-environment for big Arduino projects (like 3D printer firmwares) that I don&#39;t really have any inclination to avoid it in the future (plus is generalizes out to non-Arduino AVR programming&nbsp;nicely).</p>
<h1>Going&nbsp;further</h1>
<p>This is just a short “I did this a few minutes ago note”. In the future I&#39;ll detail my Arduino Eclipse workspace, to add to the signal to noise ratio on that&nbsp;subject.</p>
