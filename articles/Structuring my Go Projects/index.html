          <section class="content"><p>Recently I’ve been maintaining a Github repository to serve as a generic
template for my Golang projects, and its been working rather well for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>The repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/wrouesnel/self-contained-go-project">Self-contained Go&nbsp;Project</a></p>
<p>The basic idea is that using this template, you can setup a Go project with
vendored dependencies not just for the main project but also for every tool
used in building and linting it (with the exception of <code>make</code>, <code>git</code> and a 
working Golang&nbsp;install). </p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">go get &lt;my project&gt;
<span class="built_in">cd</span> <span class="variable">$<span class="caps">GOPATH</span></span>/src/&lt;my project&gt;
make
</code></pre>
<p>does a production&nbsp;build.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-use-it">How to Use&nbsp;It</h1>
<p>Out of the box (i.e. <code>git clone https://github.com/wrouesnel/self-contained-go-project.git</code>)
on a Linux machine it should be all setup to go. I’ve made some effort to try
and remove Linux specific things from it, but since I don’t run Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> or
Windows for Go development it’s probably not working too well&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Essentially, it’ll build multi-platform, <span class="caps">CGO</span>-less binaries for any <code>main</code>
package you place in a folder underneath the <code>cmd</code> directory. Running <code>make binary</code>
will build all current commands for your current platform and symlink them into
the root folder, while running <code>make release</code> will build all binaries and then
create tarballs with the name and version in the <code>release</code> directory.</p>
<p>It also includes bevy of other <span class="caps">CI</span>-friendly commands - namely <code>make style</code> which
checks for <code>gofmt</code> and <code>goimports</code> formatting and <code>make lint</code> which runs 
<a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter">gometalinter</a> against the entire&nbsp;project.</p>
<h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
<p>Just looking at the commands, the main thing accomplished is a lot of use of
<code>make</code>. It’s practically used for ergonomics more then utility to some level
since <code>make</code> is a familiar “build whatever this is” command in the Unix&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>But, importantly, <code>make</code> is used <em>correctly</em> - build dependencies are expressed
and managed in a form it understands so it only rebuilds as&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>But there is more important element, and that is not just that there is a 
Makefile but that the repository for the project, through <code>govendor</code>ing includes
not just the code but also the linting and checking tools needed to build it,
and a mechanism to update them&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Under the <code>tools</code> directory we have a secondary <code>Makefile</code> which is called from
the top-level and is reposible for managing the tools. By running <code>make update</code>
here we can <code>go get</code> a new version of <code>gometalinter</code>, extract the list of tools
it runs, then automatically have them updated and installed inside the source
directory and made available to the top level <code>Makefile</code> to use to run <span class="caps">CI</span>&nbsp;tasks.</p>
<p>This combines to make project management <em>extremely</em> ergonomic in my opinion,
and avoids dragging a heavier tool like <code>Docker</code> into the mix (which often means
some uncontrolled external&nbsp;dependencies).</p>
<p>Basically: you check in everything your project needs to be built and run and
tested into the one Git repository, because storage is cheap but your time is
not and external dependencies can’t be trusted to always&nbsp;exist.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>It’s not the be all and end all - in build tooling there never is one, but I’m
thusfar really happy with how this basic structure has turned out as I’ve
evolved it and it’s proven relatively easy to extend when I need to (i.e.
adding more testing levels, building web assets as well with npm and including
them in the go-binary&nbsp;etc.)</p>
