<p>Some notes on running a Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 in Australia in 2018</p>
<p>My first high end phone, still perfectly capable of everything I need from a
smart phone and now dirt cheap on ebay so I'm basically going to keep buying
them till there's no more to be had (or someone releases a Spectre-immune CPU
phone I guess now).</p>
<p>Baseband: XXUGNG8
I upgraded the baseband a bunch of times including to some alleged Telstra OTA
packages, and found I lost wifi. The actual modem and APN-HLOS don't seem to
matter much but...the XXUGNG8 bootloader and related files are vitally
important to getting sound to work.</p>
<p>OS: Lineage OS
Loved Cyanogenmod, like seeing it continued. There's a patch to the SELinux
config needed on newer android to allow the proximity sensor to calibrate
properly - the symptom is an apparent freeze when making/receiving calls and
its to do with SELinux only allowing the phone to use the default prox-sensor
thresholds - which if your phone meets them, great - if not - then it will
appear broken.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to get this patched in the upstream <a href="https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/201533/">soon</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I've been maintaining a Github repository to serve as a generic
template for my Golang projects, and its been working rather well for me.</p>
<p>The repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/wrouesnel/self-contained-go-project">Self-contained Go Project</a></p>
<p>The basic idea is that using this template, you can setup a Go project with
vendored dependencies not just for the main project but also for every tool
used in building and linting it (with the exception of <code>make</code>, <code>git</code> and a 
working Golang install). </p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>go get &lt;my project&gt;
<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$GOPATH</span>/src/&lt;my project&gt;
make
</code></pre>

<p>does a production build.</p>
<h2>How to Use It</h2>
<p>Out of the box (i.e. <code>git clone https://github.com/wrouesnel/self-contained-go-project.git</code>)
on a Linux machine it should be all setup to go. I've made some effort to try
and remove Linux specific things from it, but since I don't run Mac OS or
Windows for Go development it's probably not working too well there.</p>
<p>Essentially, it'll build multi-platform, CGO-less binaries for any <code>main</code>
package you place in a folder underneath the <code>cmd</code> directory. Running <code>make binary</code>
will build all current commands for your current platform and symlink them into
the root folder, while running <code>make release</code> will build all binaries and then
create tarballs with the name and version in the <code>release</code> directory.</p>
<p>It also includes bevy of other CI-friendly commands - namely <code>make style</code> which
checks for <code>gofmt</code> and <code>goimports</code> formatting and <code>make lint</code> which runs 
<a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter">gometalinter</a> against the entire
project.</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>Just looking at the commands, the main thing accomplished is a lot of use of
<code>make</code>. It's practically used for ergonomics more then utility to some level
since <code>make</code> is a familiar "build whatever this is" command in the Unix world.</p>
<p>But, importantly, <code>make</code> is used <em>correctly</em> - build dependencies are expressed
and managed in a form it understands so it only rebuilds as necessary.</p>
<p>But there is more important element, and that is not just that there is a 
Makefile but that the repository for the project, through <code>govendor</code>ing includes
not just the code but also the linting and checking tools needed to build it,
and a mechanism to update them all.</p>
<p>Under the <code>tools</code> directory we have a secondary <code>Makefile</code> which is called from
the top-level and is reposible for managing the tools. By running <code>make update</code>
here we can <code>go get</code> a new version of <code>gometalinter</code>, extract the list of tools
it runs, then automatically have them updated and installed inside the source
directory and made available to the top level <code>Makefile</code> to use to run CI tasks.</p>
<p>This combines to make project management <em>extremely</em> ergonomic in my opinion,
and avoids dragging a heavier tool like <code>Docker</code> into the mix (which often means
some uncontrolled external dependencies).</p>
<p>Basically: you check in everything your project needs to be built and run and
tested into the one Git repository, because storage is cheap but your time is
not and external dependencies can't be trusted to always exist.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It's not the be all and end all - in build tooling there never is one, but I'm
thusfar really happy with how this basic structure has turned out as I've
evolved it and it's proven relatively easy to extend when I need to (i.e.
adding more testing levels, building web assets as well with npm and including
them in the go-binary etc.)</p>

<h2>Collecting a thread to pull on...</h2>
<p>Had an interesting problem for a while now - my desktop under linux would
<em>mostly</em> suspend and resume just fine, except when it didn't. This is annoying
as I'm the type of person who likes to leave a big dev environment running and
come back to it.</p>
<p>Power management problems are the worst type of problems to debug in many ways,
so documenting any progress I made was fairly important.</p>
<p>The Ubuntu guide to kernel suspend is the most useful one I found:
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelSuspend">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelSuspend</a></p>
<p>And the important bit is this action:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>sync &amp;&amp; echo 1 &gt; /sys/power/pm_trace &amp;&amp; pm-suspend
</code></pre>

<p>This does some kernel magic which encodes suspend/resume progress into the
systems RTC clock via a hash, which allows - if things freeze - to reboot and
grab the point at which they did. You have about 3 minutes to do so after the
next boot before the data vanishes and you grab it from <code>dmesg</code>.</p>
<p>This led to an immediate reproduction - suspend-&gt;resume worked the first time,
and then hung my system on the second time. So it works, but something gets
corrupted through the process and we need to (hopefully) just reset it on 
resume to avoid the problem.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ dmesg <span class="p">|</span> grep -A10 Magic
<span class="o">[</span>    <span class="m">3</span>.607642<span class="o">]</span>   Magic number: <span class="m">0</span>:474:178
<span class="o">[</span>    <span class="m">3</span>.625900<span class="o">]</span>   <span class="nb">hash</span> matches /build/linux-B4zRAA/linux-4.8.0/drivers/base/power/main.c:1070
<span class="o">[</span>    <span class="m">3</span>.644583<span class="o">]</span> acpi device:0e: <span class="nb">hash</span> matches
<span class="o">[</span>    <span class="m">3</span>.663313<span class="o">]</span>  platform: <span class="nb">hash</span> matches
</code></pre>

<p>That's the easy part. What the hell does it mean?</p>
<h2>Goto the Source</h2>
<p>We get a source line out of that request, and we're running an ubuntu kernel
which has a convenient source package we can grab. So let's get that so we can
account for the Ubuntu packages:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/tmp
$ uname -a
Linux will-desktop <span class="m">4</span>.8.0-19-generic <span class="c1">#21-Ubuntu SMP Thu Sep 29 19:39:23 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux</span>
$ apt-get <span class="nb">source</span> linux-image-4.8.0-19-generic-generic
</code></pre>

<p>Which leads to this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">static</span> <span class="nv">void</span> <span class="nv">async_suspend_noirq</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">void</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nv">data</span>, <span class="nv">async_cookie_t</span> <span class="nv">cookie</span><span class="ss">)</span>
{
    <span class="nv">struct</span> <span class="nv">device</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nv">dev</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">struct</span> <span class="nv">device</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="nv">data</span><span class="c1">;</span>
    <span class="nv">int</span> <span class="nv">error</span><span class="c1">;</span>

    <span class="nv">error</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">__device_suspend_noirq</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">dev</span>, <span class="nv">pm_transition</span>, <span class="nv">true</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">error</span><span class="ss">)</span> {
        <span class="nv">dpm_save_failed_dev</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">dev_name</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">dev</span><span class="ss">))</span><span class="c1">;</span>
        <span class="nv">pm_dev_err</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">dev</span>, <span class="nv">pm_transition</span>, <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s"> async</span><span class="s2">"</span>, <span class="nv">error</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
    }

    <span class="nv">put_device</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">dev</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the error line we're getting puts right on that <code>if (error)</code> line which
hopefully means this is just some device failure we can add a PM script for.</p>
<p>From <code>dmesg</code> above we've got two more things to look at - whatever <code>acpi_device:0e</code>
is and the <code>platform</code> driver for. Some googling shows that this puts us into
the category of very annoying problems: we're not even successfully getting into
the resume code, so the failure on the second resume happens very early.

<h2>Time to rebuild the kernel...</h2>
<p>Which is often less work then it sounds, but judging from that LKML link it's
pretty much the only lead we have to go on since we don't have a Thinkpad but
the problem is probably suspiciously similar.</p>

<p>I wouldn't make a post on my blog just so I don't have to keep googling something
would I? Of course I would. It's like...95% of the reason I keep this.</p>
<p>Totally static go builds - these are <em>great</em> for running in Docker containers.
The important part is the command line to create them - it's varied a bit, but
the most thorough I've found is this (see this 
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9344">Github Issue</a>):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">CGO_ENABLED</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">0</span> <span class="nv">GOOS</span><span class="o">=</span>linux go build -a -ldflags <span class="s1">'-extldflags "-static"'</span> .
</code></pre>

<p>This will create an "as static as possible" binary - beware linking in things
which want glibc, since pluggable name resolvers will be a problem (which you
can workaround in Docker quite well, but that's another question).</p>

<h2>Quickly configuring modelines?</h2>
<p>Something hopefully no one should ever have to do in the far distant future,
but since I insist on using old-hardware till it drops, it still comes up.</p>
<p>Working from an SSH console on an XBMC box, I was trying to tune in an elusive
1366x768 modeline for an old plasma TV.</p>
<p>The best way to do it is with xrandr these days in a <code>~/.xprofile</code> script which
is loaded on boot up.</p>
<p>To quickly go through modelines I used the following shell script:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
xrandr -d :0 --output VGA-0 --mode <span class="s2">"1024x768"</span>
xrandr -d :0 --delmode VGA-0 <span class="s2">"1360x768"</span>
xrandr -d :0 --rmmode <span class="s2">"1360x768"</span>
xrandr -d :0 --newmode <span class="s2">"1360x768"</span> <span class="nv">$@</span>
xrandr -d :0 --addmode VGA-0 <span class="s2">"1360x768"</span>
xrandr -d :0 --output VGA-0 --mode <span class="s2">"1360x768"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Simply passing in a modeline when running it causes that modeline to be set and
applied to the relevant output (VGA-0) in my case.</p>
<p>i.e. <code>./tryout 84.750 1366 1480 1568 1800 768 769 776 800 -hsync +vsync</code></p>

<p>Somehow the installation instructions for Docker never work for me and the
website is <em>surprisingly</em> cagey about the manual process.</p>
<p>It works perfectly well if you just grab the relevant bits of that script and
run them manually, but usually fails if you let it be a bit too magical.</p>
<p>To be fair, I probably have issues due to the mismatch of LSB release since I
run Mint. Still though.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I modified Rocky Bernsteins go-play to compile with go-assetfs and run from a
single executable. <a href="https://github.com/wrouesnel/go-play">Get it here!</a></p>
<h2>Why and How</h2>
<p>iPython is one of the things I love best about Python. In a dynamically typed
language its a huge benefit to be able to quickly and easily paste in chunks of
code and investigate what the actual output would be or what an error situation
would look like.</p>
<p><a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> is not dynamically typed, but many of the same issues
tend to apply - when errors rise they can be tricky to introspect without diving
through the code, and sometimes the syntax or results of a function call aren't
obvious.</p>
<p>As a learning tool, Go provides the <a href="http://play.golang.org">Go Playground</a> -
a web service which compiles and runs snippets of Go code within a sandbox,
which has proven a huge boon to the community for sharing and testing solutions
(its very popular on Stack Overflow).</p>
<p>The public Go playground is necessariy limited - and it would be nice to be able
to use Go in the same way clientside, or just without internet access.</p>
<p>Fortunately Rocky Bernstein pulled together an unrestricted copy of the Go
play ground which runs as a client-side HTML5 app. Unlike the web playground,
this allows unrestricted Go execution on your PC and full testing of things as
they would work locally. The Github export is found <a href="https://github.com/rocky/go-play">here</a>.</p>
<p>The one problem I had with this was that this version still exposed dependencies
on the location of source files outside the executable - which for a tiny tool
was kind of annoying. Fortunately this has been solved in Go for a long time -
and a little fun with <a href="https://github.com/elazarl/go-bindata-assetfs">go-bindata-assetfs</a>
yielded my own version which once built runs completely locally.</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/wrouesnel/go-play">Get it here</a>. It's fully go-gettable too
so <code>go get github.com/wrouesnel/go-play</code> will work too.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You have a server you can SSH to. For whatever reason AllowTCPPortForwarding
is disabled. You need to forward a port from it to your local machine.</p>
<p>If it's any sort of standard machine, then it probably has <code>netcat</code>. It's less
likely to have the far more powerful <code>socat</code> - which we'll only need locally.</p>
<p>This tiny tip servers two lessons: (1) disabling SSH port forwarding is not a
serious security measure, and far more of an anoyance. And (2) since it's pretty
likely you still need to do whatever job you need to do, it would be nice to
have a 1-liner which will just forward the port for you</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">socat</span> <span class="nv">TCP</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">LISTEN</span>:<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">local</span> <span class="nv">port</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>,<span class="nv">reuseaddr</span>,<span class="nv">fork</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">EXEC:ssh &lt;server&gt; nc localhost &lt;remote port&gt;</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>It's kind of obvious if you know socat well, but half the battle is simply
knowing it's possible.</p>
<p>Obviously you can change localhost to also be a remote server. And
this is really handy if you want to do debugging since socat can echo all
data to the console for you if you want.</p>
<h2>The Lesson</h2>
<p>As I said at the start: if you have standard tools installed, or if your users
can upload new tools (which, with shell access they can), and if you don't have
firewall rules or cgroups limitations on those accounts, then stuff like
disabled port forwards <em>is not a security measure</em>.</p>
